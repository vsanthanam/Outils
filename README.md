Outils is a library that provides type-safe APIs for working with JSON objects in Swift. It provides an idiomatic solution that is both faster and easier to use than Foundation's `JSONSerialization` API. It takes advantage of modern Swift language features, and provides APIs for easily creating, mutating, serializing, and deserializing JSON values. It also provides a system to easily encode other Swift types into a JSON representation and decode those same types from correctly shaped JSON values.

Outils is based on [Freddy](https://github.com/bignerdranch/Freddy), an early library for working with JSON in Swift that is no longer maintained by its original authors. The library itself has no non-Apple dependencies, but the package does use the [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) and [DocC](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc-plugin) Swift Package Manager plugins.

## Installation

Outils is a collection of Swift functions and library extensions that I find myself regularly re-creating in my projects. They contain free standing functions and types, as well as extensions on Swift standard library, `Foundation`, `UIKit`, and `SwiftUI`.

To add Outils as a dependency to an existing Swift package, add the following line of code to the `dependencies` parameter of your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/vsanthanam/Outils.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.0"))
]
```

To add Outils as a dependency to an Xcode Project: 

- Choose `File` â†’ `Add Packages...`
- Enter package URL `https://github.com/vsanthanam/Outils.git` and select your release and of choice.

Other distribution mechanisms like CocoaPods or Carthage may be added in the future.

## Usage & Documentation

Outils's documentation is built with [DocC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc) and included in the repository as a DocC archive. The latest version is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and is available [here](https://vsanthanam.github.io/Outils/docs/documentation/outils).
