Outils is a collection of Swift functions and library extensions that I find myself regularly re-creating in my projects. They contain free standing functions and types, as well as extensions on Swift standard library, Foundation, UIKit, and SwiftUI.

## Installation

To add Outils as a dependency to an existing Swift package, add the following line of code to the `dependencies` parameter of your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/vsanthanam/Outils.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.0"))
]
```

To add Outils as a dependency to an Xcode Project: 

- Choose `File` â†’ `Add Packages...`
- Enter package URL `https://github.com/vsanthanam/Outils.git` and select your release and of choice.

Other distribution mechanisms like CocoaPods or Carthage may be added in the future.
